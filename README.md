# Grumpy's Stuff

This is a directory of the stuff I've put together for 7 Days to Die.  They mostly require Khaine's fantastic [Darkness Falls](https://gitlab.com/KhaineGB/darkness-falls-a20/-/tree/main) mod.

* [Old Grumpy County](https://github.com/grumpygabe/DF-GrumpyMap) is a 6k map pack for Darkness Falls.  It is relatively small and dense, with limited starting locations for small group play and some interesting topography/roads.
* [CoronaWipes](https://github.com/grumpygabe/DF-CoronaWipes) is a silly mod I was inspired to make by the billboards you can find in vanilla.  It adds some really bad healing items and also twinkies as an apology.
* [DF-FertilizerFix](https://github.com/grumpygabe/DF-FertilizerFix/tree/main) is a simple fix to make fertilizer work (more?) correctly in Darkness Falls.
* [DF-HeadshotsMostly](https://github.com/grumpygabe/DF-HeadshotsMostly/tree/main) lets you configure a less binary "HeadshotsOnly" mode.

I've also put together two compatibility patches for mods we love to use with Darkness Falls:

* [DF-UBBI-Compat-Patch](https://github.com/grumpygabe/DF-UBBI-Compat-Patch) makes the A19 version Ztensity's UBBI mod work with A20 Darkness Falls (and gives the containers the increased storage size). :warning:**Note** Ztensity has now updated [UBBI for A20](https://www.nexusmods.com/7daystodie/mods/1242), so it would probably be better to just use that one. 
* [DF-ElectricityLamps-Compat-Patch](https://github.com/grumpygabe/DF-ElectricityLamps-Compat-Patch) makes ocbMaurice's [ElectricityLamps](https://github.com/OCB7D2D/ElectricityLamps) mod work with Darkness Falls. ⚠️**WORD OF WARNING**:warning:  While this one tested fine in single player, I've been getting *intense* framerate issues on multiplayer as soon as one of these lights gets dropped.
