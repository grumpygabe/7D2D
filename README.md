# Grumpy's Stuff

This is a directory of the stuff I've put together for 7 Days to Die.  They mostly require Khaine's fantastic [Darkness Falls](https://gitlab.com/KhaineGB/darkness-falls-a20/-/tree/main) mod.

* [Old Grumpy County](https://github.com/grumpygabe/DF-GrumpyMap) is a 6k map pack for Darkness Falls.  It is relatively small and dense, with limited starting locations for small group play and some interesting topography/roads.
* [CoronaWipes](https://github.com/grumpygabe/DF-CoronaWipes) is a silly mod I was inspired to make by the billboards you can find in vanilla.  It adds some really bad healing items and also twinkies as an apology.

I've also put together two compatibility patches for mods we love to use with Darkness Falls:

* [DF-UBBI-Compat-Patch](https://github.com/grumpygabe/DF-UBBI-Compat-Patch) makes Ztensity's [UBBI](https://www.nexusmods.com/7daystodie/mods/1242) mod work with Darkness Falls (and gives the containers the increased storage size).
* [DF-ElectricityLamps-Compat-Patch](https://github.com/grumpygabe/DF-ElectricityLamps-Compat-Patch) makes ocbMaurice's [ElectricityLamps](https://github.com/OCB7D2D/ElectricityLamps) mod work with Darkness Falls.
