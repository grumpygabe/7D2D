# Grumpy's Stuff

This is a directory of the stuff I've put together for 7 Days to Die.  They mostly require Khaine's fantastic [Darkness Falls](https://gitlab.com/KhaineGB/darkness-falls-a20/-/tree/main) mod.

Maps
* [Grumpy's CompoPack Map](https://github.com/grumpygabe/Grumpy-s-CompoPack-Maps) is another 6k map set up for small group multiplayer.  Very large cities for a 6k map.
* [Grumpyville](https://github.com/grumpygabe/DF-Grumpyville) is a 6k map featuring a giant city for Darkness Falls. It features limited starting locations for facilitate groups.
* [Old Grumpy County](https://github.com/grumpygabe/DF-GrumpyMap) is a 6k map pack for Darkness Falls.  It is relatively small and dense, with limited starting locations for small group play and some interesting topography/roads.

Other Modlets
* [DF-GrumpysAesthetics](https://github.com/grumpygabe/5-DFGrumpysAesthetics) adds a bunch of aesthetic options to Darkness Falls - more lockable storage options, a new working oven and working sink, and a few farm plots.
* [CoronaWipes](https://github.com/grumpygabe/DF-CoronaWipes) is a silly mod I was inspired to make by the billboards you can find in vanilla.  It adds some really bad healing items and also twinkies as an apology.
* [DF-FertilizerFix](https://github.com/grumpygabe/DF-FertilizerFix/tree/main) is a simple fix to make fertilizer work (more?) correctly in Darkness Falls.
* [DF-HeadshotsMostly](https://github.com/grumpygabe/DF-HeadshotsMostly/tree/main) lets you configure a less binary "HeadshotsOnly" mode.
